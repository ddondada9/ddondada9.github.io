Project Overview
Context
The study aimed to analyze consumer data to identify key drivers of travel insurance purchases. Using demographic and travel-related features, the goal was to enhance targeted marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and guide product development.
Actions
1. Cleaned and prepared a dataset of 1,986 records for analysis.
2. Applied three main analytical techniques: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K-Means Clustering.
3. Evaluated models for accuracy and interpretability to derive meaningful insights.
4. Segmented customers into actionable clusters using K-Means for personalized marketing.
Results
- Decision Tree Accuracy: 83%
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 74%
- Key predictors included frequent flyer status, international travel, and age.
Growth/Next Steps
1. Address dataset limitations by incorporating additional variables such as risk perception.
2. Expand to larger datasets for improved model generalizability.
3. Automate scoring models to prioritize high-value customers.
Data Insights
Dataset and Preprocessing
- Source: 2019 dataset of Indian customers.
- Features: Demographic, travel, and insurance-specific variables.
- Preprocessing Steps:
  - Removed missing values and irrelevant columns.
  - Standardized numerical data.
  - Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
Analysis Highlights
1. Decision Tree Analysis
- Methodology: Limited depth to prevent overfitting. Used Gini Impurity to split nodes.
- Findings:
  - Likelihood of purchase increases for individuals older than 32.5 years, earning over 1.7M Rupees, with smaller families, and no chronic diseases.
- Metrics:
  - Accuracy: 83%
  - F1 Score: 0.72
- Visualization: The full decision tree was plotted to demonstrate key decision points.

Output



2. Logistic Regression Analysis
- Methodology: Evaluated odds ratios for feature impact.
- Findings:
  - Frequent flyers are 42.6% more likely to purchase insurance.
  - Customers who have traveled abroad are 125.9% more likely to purchase insurance.
  - Age, employment type, and chronic diseases negatively influenced likelihood.
- Metrics:
  - Accuracy: 74%
  - F1 Score: 0.73
Recommendations
1. Targeted Marketing Campaigns: Focus on high-income, older age brackets for premium products.
2. Loyalty Programs: Develop incentives for frequent flyers.
3. Product Innovation:
   - Family-oriented plans with bundled discounts.
   - Multi-trip packages for frequent travelers.
4. Operational Efficiency: Use logistic regression probability scores to prioritize leads.
Discussion & Future Steps
1. Enhance data granularity by including variables like customer risk perception.
2. Investigate mismatches in findings between models for refined parameter prioritization.
3. Explore alternative clustering methods and distance metrics for improved segmentation.


3. K-Means Clustering Analysis
Methodology:
The elbow method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters. Four clusters were selected based on the analysis. Features were scaled using StandardScaler before applying the K-Means algorithm.

Clusters Identified:

High-Income Frequent Travelers: Best suited for premium insurance plans and loyalty incentives.
Younger, Low-Income Individuals: Ideal for entry-level, budget-friendly offerings.
Middle-Income Occasional Travelers: Marketing campaigns should emphasize the value of coverage for this segment.
Low-Income Infrequent Travelers: This group has minimal purchase likelihood; resources should be cautiously allocated.
Visualization:
Clusters were visualized using key features such as Age and Annual Income. The centroids of the clusters were plotted to understand the central tendencies of each group.

Insights:
K-Means clustering effectively segmented customers into actionable groups, helping align product offerings and marketing strategies with specific customer profiles.
